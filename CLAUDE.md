Rust (axum) backend + Vite/React frontend.

## After making changes

- **Backend changes** (`src/`): run `make install` to rebuild the server, reinstall, and restart the service.
- **Frontend changes** (`frontend/`): run `make install` to rebuild the frontend, reinstall, and restart the service.
- **Both**: `make install` handles everything in one step.

Always run `make install` after changes so the running service picks them up.
